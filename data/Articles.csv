52633a4d3202,Apple pulls US immigration official tracking apps,"A number of apps were released this year in response to President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and an upsurge in ICE raids. Critics - such as the creator of ICEBlock - accuse the government of abusing its powers and ""bringing terror"" to US streets. The free app works by allowing users to report sightings of ICE officers. It has been downloaded more than a million times in the US. However, Bondi argued it was being used to target ICE officers. The FBI says the man who targeted an ICE facility in Dallas in September - killing two detainees - had used similar apps to track the movements of agents and their vehicles. In a statement Apple said: ""We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. ""Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store."" But its creator, Joshua Aaron, denied it posed a threat. ""ICEBlock is no different from crowd sourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple's own Maps app,"" he said. ""This is protected speech under the first amendment of the United States Constitution."" Mr Aaron - who has worked in the tech industry for years - previously told BBC Verify he developed the app out of concern over a spike in immigration raids. ""I certainly watched pretty closely during Trump's first administration and then I listened to the rhetoric during the campaign for the second,"" he said. ""My brain started firing on what was going to happen and what I could do to keep people safe."" The White House and FBI had criticised the app after it launched in April and downloads rose. In a statement to the BBC a spokesperson for the Department for Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said: ""ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings."" ""But, of course, the media spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of preventing further bloodshed and stopping law enforcement from getting killed,"" she added. The creator of the app ICE Immigration Alerts, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that it was pulled from Apple and Google's app platforms within hours of each other. They said Apple had informed them the app was taken down at the request of ""law enforcement"" over similar concerns it could be used to harm officers. Separately, Google allegedly told them the app had been removed over concern it would ""undermine user trust in the Google Play ecosystem"". ""Apple did not offer an opportunity to appeal the decision,"" said the app's developer, who is based in New Zealand. ""Google gave me seven days to appeal but without any clear explanation it is difficult to appeal, and I don't want to risk them further affecting my account."" ""It is a somewhat chilling commentary on free speech,"" they added. ""No dangerous incidents have ever occurred as far as I know. It's just about controlling the information unfortunately."" The BBC has approached Apple for comment. In a statement, Google confirmed it had removed ""similar apps"" to ICEBlock for ""violations of [its] policies."" It did not say which apps, or the nature of the violations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y1egzlko,technology,BBC,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5032/live/06d111e0-a053-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg,2025-10-03T15:52:00.528000+00:00
ea303e4d353c,Japan faces Asahi beer shortage after cyber-attack,"Japan is facing a shortage of Asahi products, including beer and bottled tea, as the drinks giant grapples with the impact of a major cyber-attack that has affected its operations in the country. Most of the Asahi Group's factories in Japan have been at a standstill since Monday, after the attack hit its ordering and delivering systems. Major Japanese retailers, including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, have now warned customers to expect shortages of Asahi products. In a statement on Friday , Asahi said it was ""unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery"" but had started ""partial manual"" processing of orders and shipments. Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers. It owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, Asahi has said that only its operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack. In its latest statement, Asahi said that as a result of containment measures following the attack, ordering and shipment systems in Japan had been affected and it was also unable to receive emails from external sources. ""Although system-based order and shipment processes remain suspended, ensuring product supply to customers has been set as our top priority and we have begun partial manual order processing and shipment,"" it said. Asahi also said it was preparing to reopen its call centre operations next week. Atsushi Katsuki, Asahi president and group chief executive, apologised for the disruption. ""We are making every effort to restore the system as quickly as possible, while implementing alternative measures to ensure continued product supply to our customers,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday, FamilyMart - which is one of Japan's largest convenience stores - said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock. ""We sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,"" said FamilyMart, adding that it was working with Asahi to resume the sale of the products. 7-Eleven, the Japanese-owned global convenience store chain, has halted shipments in the country of Asahi products, including its popular Super Dry beer. A spokesperson for 7-Eleven said its shops have been advised to expect a shortage of Asahi products. Lawson, another major Japanese retailer, also said it expected some Asahi products to be in short supply from Friday. The retailer said it planned to stock up on alternative products to minimise the impact on customers. Japanese supermarket chain Life Cooperation also warned that Asahi products may soon go out of stock.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r0y14ly5ro,technology,BBC,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/697e/live/62a6c8a0-a00a-11f0-a884-c9c349ad39f4.jpg,2025-10-03T10:26:49.912000+00:00
7b492e5620a6,Hackers say they have deleted children's pictures and data after nursery attack backlash,"Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data about children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information. The criminals began posting profiles of the children to their website last Thursday, adding another 10 children days later and vowing to continue until Kido Schools paid a ransom in Bitcoin. The criminals also contacted parents directly with threatening phone calls whilst trying to get their ransom paid. But public revulsion at their attack appears to have forced the criminals to backtrack. First they blurred the images but kept the data up - now they have taken all the information offline, and apologised for their actions. Their apparent change of heart has been met with scepticism by experts, who had previously condemned the targeting of nurseries as a ""new low"" for cyber-criminals. ""This is more about pragmatism than morality,"" said cyber-security expert Jen Ellis. ""These criminals are clearly shocked and worried by the attention their hack has caused and they are trying to protect themselves or their brand."" The hackers claim to have deleted everything they took - which included the private details and pictures of around 8,000 children as well as contact information for parents and carers. ""All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents,"" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC. It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around £600,000. Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on. When the UK's National Crime Agency took down the cyber crime gang LockBit they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted. The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them. ""We are sorry for hurting kids,"" the cyber-criminals told BBC News. It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past. This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack. In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the chaos contributed to the death of an emergency care patient. When Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals. Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin to charities. The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker. In a common process, the ""initial access broker"" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data. The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised. It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point. Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. A spokesperson said only that: ""We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. ""We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them."" Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rv83mrlyyo,technology,BBC,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b0d0/live/7387ec40-9ef1-11f0-966a-39edada3cd47.jpg,2025-10-01T23:01:12.780000+00:00
08ed6a828d81,Xbox Game Pass price increase angers players,"Xbox Game Pass price increase angers players Georgia Levy-Collins and Peter Gillibrand BBC Newsbeat Activision The Call of Duty series is one of the biggest titles available via Xbox Game Pass Fans have reacted angrily after Microsoft announced price increases to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service. The company announced that the most popular tier of its Netflix-style video games system - available to PC and Xbox players - would rise by more than 50% from £14.99 to £22.99 per month. Reacting on social media, loads of fans said they had cancelled their Game Pass subscriptions, with some reporting the service's cancellation page had crashed due to demand. BBC Newsbeat has asked Microsoft if the outage was linked to a surge in visits. Xbox Game Pass changes In a blog post detailing the changes to Game Pass, Microsoft said it would offer three tiers - Essential (£10 per month), Premium (£14.99) and Ultimate (£22.99). The basic package is required for anyone wishing to play online multiplayer, and the more expensive versions give access to a wider range of games and perks. Ultimate - the most expensive tier - allows players to access new games from Microsoft-owned studios on the day of their release. These titles, which include series like Call of Duty, can retail for about £70 if purchased individually. As part of the changes, blockbuster games including Hogwarts Legacy and various Assassin's Creed entries have been added to the Game Pass library. Microsoft said the new system would ""offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players"". But not everyone sees it that way. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Silksong was held up as an example of indie games available on Game Pass Ed Nightingale, deputy news editor of website Eurogamer , tells Newsbeat the popularity of gaming subscription services has increased in recent years. According to stats from the UK's Entertainment Retail Association, Game Pass and Sony's similar PlayStation Plus offering saw growth in users last year. ""Games nowadays are just more expensive,"" says Ed. ""Everything is going up in price at the moment. ""It's a lot cheaper for consumers to buy a subscription service than individual games."" When Game Pass first launched, it was pitched as ""the best deal in gaming"", though critics questioned if it would be able to keep prices down as costs of game development increased. Ed wonders if players are starting to agree that it's ""too good to be true"", and worries game companies risk pricing customers out of the hobby. ""Over the course of a year it's really expensive,"" he says. ""It is a huge price increase. ""They want to be the favourites of gamers but this feels quite anti-consumer by putting the price up. ""Microsoft are shooting themselves in the foot here."" The company has insisted Game Pass makes a profit , and said last year was its best ever in terms of revenue from subscriptions. The rising cost of gaming Microsoft Microsoft's also hiked the price of its Xbox consoles this year. Microsoft had already announced plans to increase prices of its Xbox consoles, accessories and games this year. The move was linked to US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, although Microsoft never confirmed this, blaming ""market conditions"" and the rising cost of game development. Sony gave a similar reason when it increased the price of certain PlayStation 5 models. Nintendo, which released its Switch 2 console earlier this year, increased the price of some accessories, and has also been criticised over the price of its flagship new releases . Microsoft also cancelled some gaming projects earlier this year, as part of 9,000 layoffs across the entire company. Price increases and job losses have been linked to its plans to spend billions on artificial intelligence . BBC Newsbeat has approached Microsoft for comment.

c7ef2347bbf7,"TikTok recommends porn to children, says report","TikTok recommends porn to children, says report Angus Crawford BBC News Investigations Getty Images TikTok's algorithm recommends pornography and highly sexualised content to children's accounts, according to a new report by a human rights campaign group. Researchers created fake child accounts and activated safety settings but still received sexually explicit search suggestions. The suggested search terms led to sexualised material including explicit videos of penetrative sex. The platform says it is committed to safe and age-appropriate experiences and took immediate action once it knew of the problem. In late July and early August this year, researchers from campaign group Global Witness set up four accounts on TikTok pretending to be 13-year-olds. They used false dates of birth and were not asked to provide any other information to confirm their identities. Pornography They also turned on the platform's ""restricted mode"", which TikTok says prevents users seeing ""mature or complex themes, such as… sexually suggestive content"". Without doing any searches themselves, investigators found overtly sexualised search terms being recommended in the ""you may like"" section of the app. Those search terms led to content of women simulating masturbation. Other videos showed women flashing their underwear in public places or exposing their breasts. At its most extreme, the content included explicit pornographic films of penetrative sex. These videos were embedded in other innocent content in a successful attempt to avoid content moderation. Ava Lee from Global Witness said the findings came as a ""huge shock"" to researchers. ""TikTok isn't just failing to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content - it's suggesting it to them as soon as they create an account"". Global Witness is a campaign group which usually investigates how big tech affects discussions about human rights, democracy and climate change. Researchers stumbled on this problem while conducting other research in April this year. Videos removed They informed TikTok, which said it had taken immediate action to resolve the problem. But in late July and August this year, the campaign group repeated the exercise and found once again that the app was recommending sexual content. TikTok says that it has more than 50 features designed to keep teens safe: ""We are fully committed to providing safe and age-appropriate experiences"". The app says it removes nine out of 10 videos that violate its guidelines before they are ever viewed. When informed by Global Witness of its findings, TikTok says it took action to ""remove content that violated our policies and launch improvements to our search suggestion feature"". Children's Codes On 25 July this year, the Online Safety Act's Children's Codes came into force, imposing a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms now have to use ""highly effective age assurance"" to stop children from seeing pornography. They must also adjust their algorithms to block content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. Global Witness carried out its second research project after the Children's Codes came into force. Ava Lee from Global Witness said: ""Everyone agrees that we should keep children safe online… Now it's time for regulators to step in."" During their work, researchers also observed the reaction of other users to the sexualised search terms they were being recommended. One commenter wrote: ""can someone explain to me what is up w my search recs pls?"" Another asked: ""what's wrong with this app?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708v7qkeg1o,technology,BBC,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15a1/live/55e4db20-9ebb-11f0-85b6-27ff7e482819.jpg,2025-10-03T00:45:54.272000+00:00
