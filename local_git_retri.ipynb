Critics - such as the creator of ICEBlock - accuse the government of abusing its powers and \"bringing terror\" to US streets. The free app works by allowing users to report sightings of ICE officers. It has been downloaded more than a million times in the US. However, Bondi argued it was being used to target ICE officers. The FBI says the man who targeted an ICE facility in Dallas in September - killing two detainees - had used similar apps to track the movements of agents and their vehicles. In a statement Apple said: \"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\" But its creator, Joshua Aaron, denied it posed a threat. \"ICEBlock is no different from crowd sourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple's own Maps app,\" he said. \"This is protected speech under the first amendment of the United States Constitution.\" Mr Aaron - who has worked in the tech industry for years - previously told BBC Verify he developed the app out of concern over a spike in immigration raids. \"I certainly watched pretty closely during Trump's first administration and then I listened to the rhetoric during the campaign for the second,\" he said. \"My brain started firing on what was going to happen and what I could do to keep people safe.\" The White House and FBI had criticised the app after it launched in April and downloads rose. In a statement to the BBC a spokesperson for the Department for Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said: \"ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.\" \"But, of course, the media spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of preventing further bloodshed and stopping law enforcement from getting killed,\" she added. The creator of the app ICE Immigration Alerts, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that it was pulled from Apple and Google's app platforms within hours of each other. They said Apple had informed them the app was taken down at the request of \"law enforcement\" over similar concerns it could be used to harm officers. Separately, Google allegedly told them the app had been removed over concern it would \"undermine user trust in the Google Play ecosystem\". \"Apple did not offer an opportunity to appeal the decision,\" said the app's developer, who is based in New Zealand. \"Google gave me seven days to appeal but without any clear explanation it is difficult to appeal, and I don't want to risk them further affecting my account.\" \"It is a somewhat chilling commentary on free speech,\" they added. \"No dangerous incidents have ever occurred as far as I know. It's just about controlling the information unfortunately.\" The BBC has approached Apple for comment. In a statement, Google confirmed it had removed \"similar apps\" to ICEBlock for \"violations of [its] policies.\" It did not say which apps, or the nature of the violations. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708y1egzlko technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5032/live/06d111e0-a053-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg 2025-10-03T15:52:00.528000+00:00\n",

Researchers created fake child accounts and activated safety settings but still received sexually explicit search suggestions. The suggested search terms led to sexualised material including explicit videos of penetrative sex. The platform says it is committed to safe and age-appropriate experiences and took immediate action once it knew of the problem. In late July and early August this year, researchers from campaign group Global Witness set up four accounts on TikTok pretending to be 13-year-olds. They used false dates of birth and were not asked to provide any other information to confirm their identities. Pornography They also turned on the platform's \"restricted mode\", which TikTok says prevents users seeing \"mature or complex themes, such as‚Ä¶ sexually suggestive content\". Without doing any searches themselves, investigators found overtly sexualised search terms being recommended in the \"you may like\" section of the app. Those search terms led to content of women simulating masturbation. Other videos showed women flashing their underwear in public places or exposing their breasts. At its most extreme, the content included explicit pornographic films of penetrative sex. These videos were embedded in other innocent content in a successful attempt to avoid content moderation. Ava Lee from Global Witness said the findings came as a \"huge shock\" to researchers. \"TikTok isn't just failing to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content - it's suggesting it to them as soon as they create an account\". Global Witness is a campaign group which usually investigates how big tech affects discussions about human rights, democracy and climate change. Researchers stumbled on this problem while conducting other research in April this year. Videos removed They informed TikTok, which said it had taken immediate action to resolve the problem. But in late July and August this year, the campaign group repeated the exercise and found once again that the app was recommending sexual content. TikTok says that it has more than 50 features designed to keep teens safe: \"We are fully committed to providing safe and age-appropriate experiences\". The app says it removes nine out of 10 videos that violate its guidelines before they are ever viewed. When informed by Global Witness of its findings, TikTok says it took action to \"remove content that violated our policies and launch improvements to our search suggestion feature\". Children's Codes On 25 July this year, the Online Safety Act's Children's Codes came into force, imposing a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms now have to use \"highly effective age assurance\" to stop children from seeing pornography. They must also adjust their algorithms to block content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. Global Witness carried out its second research project after the Children's Codes came into force.

Most of the Asahi Group's factories in Japan have been at a standstill since Monday, after the attack hit its ordering and delivering systems. Major Japanese retailers, including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, have now warned customers to expect shortages of Asahi products. In a statement on Friday , Asahi said it was \"unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery\" but had started \"partial manual\" processing of orders and shipments. Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers. It owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, Asahi has said that only its operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack. In its latest statement, Asahi said that as a result of containment measures following the attack, ordering and shipment systems in Japan had been affected and it was also unable to receive emails from external sources. \"Although system-based order and shipment processes remain suspended, ensuring product supply to customers has been set as our top priority and we have begun partial manual order processing and shipment,\" it said. Asahi also said it was preparing to reopen its call centre operations next week. Atsushi Katsuki, Asahi president and group chief executive, apologised for the disruption. \"We are making every effort to restore the system as quickly as possible, while implementing alternative measures to ensure continued product supply to our customers,\" he said. In a statement on Thursday, FamilyMart - which is one of Japan's largest convenience stores - said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock. \"We sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,\" said FamilyMart, adding that it was working with Asahi to resume the sale of the products. 7-Eleven, the Japanese-owned global convenience store chain, has halted shipments in the country of Asahi products, including its popular Super Dry beer. A spokesperson for 7-Eleven said its shops have been advised to expect a shortage of Asahi products. Lawson, another major Japanese retailer, also said it expected some Asahi products to be in short supply from Friday. The retailer said it planned to stock up on alternative products to minimise the impact on customers. Japanese supermarket chain Life Cooperation also warned that Asahi products may soon go out of stock. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r0y14ly5ro technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/697e/live/62a6c8a0-a00a-11f0-a884-c9c349ad39f4.jpg 2025-10-03T10:26:49.912000+00:00\n",
      "7b492e5620a6 Hackers say they have deleted children's pictures and data after nursery attack backlash Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data about children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information. The criminals began posting profiles of the children to their website last Thursday, adding another 10 children days later and vowing to continue until Kido Schools paid a ransom in Bitcoin. The criminals also contacted parents directly with threatening phone calls whilst trying to get their ransom paid. But public revulsion at their attack appears to have forced the criminals to backtrack. First they blurred the images but kept the data up - now they have taken all the information offline, and apologised for their actions. Their apparent change of heart has been met with scepticism by experts, who had previously condemned the targeting of nurseries as a \"new low\" for cyber-criminals. \"This is more about pragmatism than morality,\" said cyber-security expert Jen Ellis. \"These criminals are clearly shocked and worried by the attention their hack has caused and they are trying to protect themselves or their brand.\" The hackers claim to have deleted everything they took - which included the private details and pictures of around 8,000 children as well as contact information for parents and carers. \"All child data is now being deleted. No more remains and this can comfort parents,\" one of the cyber-criminals involved told the BBC. It's understood Kido have not paid the hackers a ransom which was thought to be around ¬£600,000. Past cases have shown that hackers often say they have deleted stolen data and been found to have kept it or sold it on. When the UK's National Crime Agency took down the cyber crime gang LockBit they discovered troves of data still on the criminal's servers that victims had paid to be deleted. The nursery hackers, calling themselves Radiant, appear to be concerned that their hack has crossed an undefined moral line since the public outcry began against them. \"We are sorry for hurting kids,\" the cyber-criminals told BBC News. It's not known who the hackers or hacker are but they appear to be a new and possibly inexperienced group. Their darknet site is newly created but they claim to have carried out other hacks in the past. This isn't the first time that cyber-criminals have backtracked on an attack. In 2020 a gang using Dopplepaymer ransomware gifted their encryption key to a German hospital after the chaos contributed to the death of an emergency care patient. When Conti hackers attacked the Irish Health Service in 2021 they too gave their antidote away for free claiming not to have deliberately targeted hospitals. Months before, criminals from the Darkside group took the strange decision to post proof that they had donated some of their ill-gotten bitcoin to charities. The nursery hackers claimed they broke into the nursery's systems by buying access to one of Kido's staff computers which was compromised by a separate hacker. In a common process, the \"initial access broker\" sold the Kido access to Radiant, which went on to further infiltrate Kido's systems and steal the data. The majority of the downloaded material including the pictures of children was taken from Kido's account with Famly - a popular early years education platform . Famly has rejected Kido's message to parents that the breach happened as a result of Famly being compromised. It has stressed to the BBC that neither the security or infrastructure of the platform has been compromised at any point. Kido did not respond to a request for comment about the way the hackers stole the data. A spokesperson said only that: \"We recently identified and responded to a cyber incident. We are working with external specialists to investigate and determine what happened in more detail. \"We swiftly informed both our families and the relevant authorities and continue to liaise closely with them.\" Radiant says it paid the initial access broker money for access to Kido's system. So with Kido refusing to pay and the hackers giving up their extortion attempt the criminals appear to have actually lost money in this cyber-attack. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rv83mrlyyo technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b0d0/live/7387ec40-9ef1-11f0-966a-39edada3cd47.jpg 2025-10-01T23:01:12.780000+00:00\n",

The company announced that the most popular tier of its Netflix-style video games system - available to PC and Xbox players - would rise by more than 50% from ¬£14.99 to ¬£22.99 per month. Reacting on social media, loads of fans said they had cancelled their Game Pass subscriptions, with some reporting the service's cancellation page had crashed due to demand. BBC Newsbeat has asked Microsoft if the outage was linked to a surge in visits. Xbox Game Pass changes In a blog post detailing the changes to Game Pass, Microsoft said it would offer three tiers - Essential (¬£10 per month), Premium (¬£14.99) and Ultimate (¬£22.99). The basic package is required for anyone wishing to play online multiplayer, and the more expensive versions give access to a wider range of games and perks. Ultimate - the most expensive tier - allows players to access new games from Microsoft-owned studios on the day of their release. These titles, which include series like Call of Duty, can retail for about ¬£70 if purchased individually. As part of the changes, blockbuster games including Hogwarts Legacy and various Assassin's Creed entries have been added to the Game Pass library. Microsoft said the new system would \"offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players\". But not everyone sees it that way. Team Cherry Hollow Knight: Silksong was held up as an example of indie games available on Game Pass Ed Nightingale, deputy news editor of website Eurogamer , tells Newsbeat the popularity of gaming subscription services has increased in recent years. According to stats from the UK's Entertainment Retail Association, Game Pass and Sony's similar PlayStation Plus offering saw growth in users last year. \"Games nowadays are just more expensive,\" says Ed. \"Everything is going up in price at the moment. \"It's a lot cheaper for consumers to buy a subscription service than individual games.\" When Game Pass first launched, it was pitched as \"the best deal in gaming\", though critics questioned if it would be able to keep prices down as costs of game development increased. Ed wonders if players are starting to agree that it's \"too good to be true\", and worries game companies risk pricing customers out of the hobby. \"Over the course of a year it's really expensive,\" he says. \"It is a huge price increase. \"They want to be the favourites of gamers but this feels quite anti-consumer by putting the price up. \"Microsoft are shooting themselves in the foot here.\" The company has insisted Game Pass makes a profit , and said last year was its best ever in terms of revenue from subscriptions. The rising cost of gaming Microsoft Microsoft's also hiked the price of its Xbox consoles this year. Microsoft had already announced plans to increase prices of its Xbox consoles, accessories and games this year. The move was linked to US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, although Microsoft never confirmed this, blaming \"market conditions\" and the rising cost of game development. Sony gave a similar reason when it increased the price of certain PlayStation 5 models. Nintendo, which released its Switch 2 console earlier this year, increased the price of some accessories, and has also been criticised over the price of its flagship new releases . Microsoft also cancelled some gaming projects earlier this year, as part of 9,000 layoffs across the entire company. Price increases and job losses have been linked to its plans to spend billions on artificial intelligence . BBC Newsbeat has approached Microsoft for comment.

The tech magnate's net worth briefly reached $500.1bn on Wednesday afternoon New York time, before dipping slightly to just over $499bn later in the day, the Forbes billionaires index reported. Alongside Tesla, valuations of his other ventures, including the artificial intelligence start-up xAI and rocket company SpaceX, have also reportedly climbed in recent months. The milestone further cements Musk's status as the world's richest person, well ahead of rivals in the global tech sector. According to Forbes' billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison is the world's second richest person, with a fortune of about $350.7bn. Mr Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after shares in Oracle soared by more than 40%, boosted by the firm's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals. Musk's huge wealth is closely tied to his more than 12% stake in Tesla, which has seen its shares rise sharply this year. Tesla shares were more than 3.3% higher at the end of New York trading on Wednesday and have now risen by over 20% this year. The company's shares have been making gains in recent months as investors welcome Musk focusing more time on his companies rather than politics. He faced criticism earlier this year over his work with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs. Musk, who also owns the X social media platform, has also been vocal about his views on issues such as immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes. The chair of Tesla's board, Robyn Denholm, said in September that Musk was now \"front and centre\" at the carmaker. The company's board also said Musk could receive a pay package worth over $1tn if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade. To get the package he would need to boost Tesla's value eightfold, sell a million AI robots, sell another 12 million Tesla cars, and hit several other goals. Also last month, Musk announced that he had bought about $1bn worth of Tesla shares in what has been seen by some investors as a vote of confidence in the firm.

It is the latest development in the ongoing dispute between Apple and the Home Office over data privacy. The UK says it needs to be able to access individuals' private data - when backed by an appropriate warrant - if there is a threat to national security. Apple maintains that privacy is at the heart of its business and says it will not compromise on data protection anywhere in the world. The Home Office has declined to comment. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a Home Office spokesperson said. \"We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.\" As first reported by the Financial Times , the new instruction is understood to replace a previous order stating that the UK authorities needed to be able to access the data of Apple users anywhere in the world, in the event of a national security risk. This infuriated the US administration, with Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, describing it as a \"clear and egregious violation of Americans' privacy and civil liberties\". Ms Gabbard said in August the UK had withdrawn its demand . It is possible that the latest order, which does not include Apple customers outside the UK, is designed as a compromise. In the early stages of the row, Apple removed its toughest data protection tool, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), from the UK market and embarked on legal action . A tribunal hearing is still due to take place in January 2026. Security concerns Although some existing users still have it for now, Apple said in a statement it was \"gravely disappointed\" that it could no longer offer ADP in the UK. \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" it said, citing rising incidents of data breaches and cyber attacks. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom,\" the company added. \"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\" The firm cannot legally comment on the existence of these orders because they are supposed to be kept secret. But a judge sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations, including the BBC, to rule that the legal row between the government and Apple could not be held in secret. \"By using a secret order to undermine the security of Apple products, the UK Government is making security harder for us all,\" said Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director for Privacy International, in a statement. \"If this new order isn't stopped, the UK Government will likely issue similar orders to other companies, too.\" https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6c43/live/45f4f830-9eca-11f0-8281-d137a399b095.jpg 2025-10-01T14:26:29.484000+00:00\n",

The popular messaging app has allowed users to save and store previously posted content in its Memories feature since it was introduced in 2016. But it says people with more than five gigabytes (GB) worth of Memories will now need to pay to keep them available. The app's parent company Snap declined to tell BBC News how much the storage plans would cost UK users, saying only the change would be made as part of a \"gradual global rollout\". Users on social media have reacted with dismay, accusing the company of being greedy. Snap has acknowledged it's \"never easy to transition from receiving a service for free to paying for it\" - but suggested it be \"worth the cost\" for users. \"These changes will allow us to continue to invest in making Memories better for our entire community,\" it said in a blog post announcing the move. It said more than one trillion Memories had been saved by users since being introduced nearly a decade ago. The feature allows users to save photos and videos shared initially for 24 hours or less on the platform, with users prompted to re-post them as a memory or \"throwback\" at a later date. Users with more than 5GB of saved Memories will be prompted to upgrade to a 100GB storage plan, under the changes. Increased levels of storage will be available to users paying for more expensive Snapchat+ and Snapchat Premium subscriptions. The company says it will provide 12 months of temporary storage for those exceeding the limit, and users can download saved content to their device. A company spokesperson told tech publication TechCrunch its initial 100GB storage plan would be priced at $1.99  (¬£1.48) per month, with 250GB included in the $3.99 (¬£2.96) cost of a Snapchat+ subscription. 'Inevitable change' Snap said in its blog post that its rollout of storage plans would not affect \"the vast majority of Snapchatters\", whom it said had less than 5GB of Memories. But the move has been criticised by some on social media, with users sharing messages sent by the platform telling them they need to pay for storage to keep their photos and videos. Some say they have used Snap's previously free storage over many years meaning they have considerably more than 5GB of data stored on the platform ‚Äì so are now facing big bills. Others say being forced to choose between paying a subscription or losing their Memories is \"unfair\" and \"greedy\" on the part of Snap. Snap said in April that Snapchat had surpassed 900 million monthly active users - while rivals such as Instagram and TikTok boast billions respectively. Drew Benvie, founder and chief executive of social media consultancy Battenhall, believes that eventually all social media platforms will charge for storage. \"The road to paying for storage on social media is inevitable,\" he told BBC News. \"In an era where we post less, but save more, this is an evolution of messaging and social media platforms.\" https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69238p5p8o technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5274/live/133063e0-9eab-11f0-9d1f-e7d83132d3ab.jpg 2025-10-01T10:13:56.412000+00:00\n",

The app - which functions like a digital notice board - hit the headlines when the 14-year-old, from Harrow, in northwest London, took her own life in 2017 after viewing self-harm content online on sites including Pinterest. A coroner later ruled the material she was exposed to contributed \"in a more than minimal way\" to her death. Addressing the case publicly for the first time, Bill Ready - who became Pinterest's boss in 2022 - said he thought about her \"every day\" and learning the lessons of her death \"guides our work\". \"As a parent of a young daughter, I can't imagine the pain Molly's family feels,\" he told the BBC. Pinterest has previously acknowledged the platform was not safe at the time of Molly's death. A hearing in 2022 was told that when she first used the platform she was exposed to a wide variety of content but in the months before she took her life that content was much more focussed on depression, self-harm and suicide. Mr Ready told the BBC the platform had since \"made significant strides\" in terms of providing \"age-appropriate, safe experiences, especially for young users.\" He highlighted how it had made accounts for under-16s fully private, and private by default for under-18s, meaning strangers cannot contact children directly - though he admitted Pinterest was still \"by no means perfect.\" Since Molly's death there has been a nationwide debate about the duty of care tech companies owe children, with calls for tighter regulation of social media. The government has sought to make children's digital lives safer through the Online Safety Act (OSA). Critics say it does not go far enough but some tech firms have complained it puts unfair restrictions on them. Mr Ready said policy-makers should ignore those who claimed social media couldn't be made safer. \"I think what politicians so often face is significant pushback from industry to say: 'well, it's just not possible to do all these things'\", he told the BBC. \"I hope our role in all this is to show that is.\" Earlier this year the company donated to the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in the teenager's memory and works to reduce suicide rates among under 25s. Reacting to Mr Ready's comments, its chief executive Andy Burrows said the charity welcomed \"any meaningful commitment from tech firms\" to learn from what happened to Molly and to make the \"safety and wellbeing of teenagers\" a priority. Social media 'crash test ratings' Mr Ready said social media companies could learn from the automotive industry which had learnt to compete on safety. \"It wasn't long ago that major carmakers said seatbelts were against their business model,\" he said. \"Now families want the cars that most exceed crash test ratings. Why shouldn't parents want the same from the apps their children use?\" He said that wasn't the case now with the tech industry split between companies \"throwing caution to the wind\" and those trying to build responsibly. \"Social media has become too toxic - the industry needs accountability,\" he said. However industry expert Matt Navarra noted that, as one of the smaller players in the market, there were limits to the impact Pinterest could have. \"Pinterest can set the example and lead safety matters in the industry if it wants to try ‚Äì but TikTok and Instagram set the rules,\" he told BBC News. \"Until the giants copy and the major platforms follow, not much changes. So Pinterest can talk safety all it likes but unless others follow suit, parents won't see much different where it really matters.\" https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62lj72zyy5o technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4dcc/live/a3820050-9ddb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg 2025-10-01T06:12:08.360000+00:00\n",

A surge in the use of mobile payments via services such as Apple Pay or Google Pay has been recorded across different age groups, figures from trade body UK Finance show. \"People are more comfortable leaving their home with just their phone,\" said Adrian Buckle, its head of research. He said the \"change of consumer behaviour\" was clear as last year marked the first time 50% of adults used mobile payments at least once a month - up from 34% in 2023. Consumers are increasingly storing card details on phones or watches and making contactless payments backed up by facial or fingerprint verification, instead of pressing in a PIN. Some 78% of 16 to 24-year-olds regularly used mobile payments last year, and even more are registered to use them. Older age groups are increasingly choosing this option too. For example, nearly two-thirds (59%) of 35 to 44-year-olds regularly made mobile payments in 2024, up from 38% a year earlier. A fifth (19%) of those aged 65 and over often paid by phone. The proportion of adults regularly using physical contactless cards dipped slightly as a result, although debit cards remain the most popular way to pay. Cash has continued to become less common in transactions - although nearly 50 million people still used ATMs. \"Cash fell below 10% of all payments,\" Mr Buckle said. \"These changes weren't just driven by younger consumers. We saw growth in mobile wallets and Buy Now Pay Later across older age groups too, highlighting how digital payments are becoming more mainstream across the board.\" Outage warning In 2023, with household finances stretched, the number of people mainly using cash picked up as it helped them to budget. That number fell last year, but campaigners say notes and coins must remain part of the mix for consumers. \"While the number of people relying on cash continues to fall, we know that those who do are often on lower incomes or the more vulnerable,\" said Adrian Roberts, deputy chief executive of Link, which oversees cash access and the ATM network. \"We must not sleepwalk into a digital-only society before everyone is ready.\" He said there were also questions over resilience for a digital-only payments system, such as the back-up options during a widespread power outage. MPs on the Treasury Committee recently said that shops and services may have to be forced to accept cash in the future to help protect vulnerable people who rely on it. Meanwhile, the UK's financial regulator has proposed that banks and card providers set their own limits on contactless card payments or are allowed to remove the current ¬£100 payment limit entirely. That would make entering a PIN even more of a rarity, as smartphones - with extra in-built security - already have no limit on contactless payments via a digital wallet. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ejvld0ypyo technology    BBC https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4768/live/cc21e390-9de5-11f0-a561-d7c24224dfc6.jpg 2025-10-01T08:49:07.196000+00:00\n",
